# MediaPipe Computer Vision Project
This repository demonstrates how to use MediaPipe, a cross-platform library developed by Google, to perform real-time computer vision tasks such as hand tracking, face detection, and more. The project focuses on leveraging pre-trained models in MediaPipe for building advanced computer vision applications.

## Features
### Hand Tracking: Detect and track hands in real-time using MediaPipe's Hand model.
### Face Detection: Use MediaPipe's Face Detection model to detect faces in images or videos.
### Object Detection: Leverage the Object Detection model for tracking objects.
### Pose Estimation: Track body poses and landmarks using the Pose model.
### Face Mesh: Analyze facial landmarks with the Face Mesh model for more detailed facial feature analysis.
